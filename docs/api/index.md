# API

Bootloader offers two kind of APIs: REST API and Profile API

# REST API

Available at `/api/<version>/` and currently partially namespaced.
In 0.0.1-alpha2 there are planned a set of improvements for proper namespaces
and tests.

# Profile API

Used in Profile YAML files(`kind: Profile`) to get proper version of API to use
with it.
